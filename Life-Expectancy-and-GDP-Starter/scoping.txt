Project Title: Life Expectancy and GDP

STEP 0
- Problem Description
Know what is the country in the dataset with better life expectancy. Compare GDP and Life Expectancy among the countries. We want to create diferent type of plots to check these assumptions
- Impact
Validate our assumpitons using visualitzations and create the project for the portfolio

STEP 1
Define goal
- What is the correlation between GDP and Life Expectancy
- There are differences among the countries
- Exist some differences depending the year

Goal (mesurable & achievable)
- Know the relation among the next variables
	- Life expectancy at birth (years)
	- GDP
	- Year
	- Country
- Generate the best plots to visualize the correlation among the variables

STEP 2
- Who will take it
Andreu Calvo
- Who is impacted
'Chile' 'China' 'Germany' 'Mexico' 'United States of America' 'Zimbabwe'
- Channels
Local files using python, one time I solve the analysis I load the project as a github repository
- Ethical implications
NONE

STEP 3
- Information
	- Granularity or detail
	It is a data with on table with 4 variables, the rows are countries in diferents years whit the Life expectancy and GDP of the population in that time
	- Frequency (update time)
	NONE
	- Hitory
	NONE
	- Identifiers
	Country, Year, Life expectancy at bith (years), GDP
	- Owner
	Codeacademy
	- Storage
	CSV. file
	- Ethics
	NONE
- Match data with the actions
	- Group by per country and create a scatter plot between the Life expectancy and GDP 
	- Create a multi barchart with all the countries divided per year 
- Get external data sources
NONE

STEP 4
- Methods: statics
- Type of analysis: Description
- Validation
	- What type of analysis needs to be done and what's the purpose?
	- How will the analysis inform the actions?
	With visual plots
	- How will the analysis be validated? What validation can be done using existing, historical data?
	Using differents type of plot to identifie the correlation among the variables 
	- What are the ethical issues associated with the analysis?
	NONE
